    <p>Now that your planning team has completed all of the preparatory work for the school EOP, Step 5 will prompt your team to format this material into a plan. Although there are many ways to format an EOP, EOP ASSIST will guide your team to create a plan with the following sections: (1) <a href="#" class="bt" title="The Basic Plan section of the school EOP provides an overview of the school’s approach to emergency operations.

Functional annexes set forth how the school manages a function before, during, and after an emergency.">Functional Annexes,</a> and (3) <a href="#" class="bt" title="The Threat- and Hazard-Specific Annexes section specifies the goals, objectives, and courses of action that a school will follow to address a particular type of threat or hazard (e.g., hurricane, active shooter).

    <p><strong>Prepare the Draft EOP </strong></p>
    <p>First, your planning team will need to create a draft of the school EOP, beginning with the threat- and hazard-specific and functional annexes. At this stage, your team has already developed the content for these annexes—which includes the <a href="#" class="bt" title="Goals are broad, general statements that indicate the desired outcome in response to a threat or hazard.">goals</a>, <a href="#" class="bt" title="Objectives are specific, measurable actions that are necessary to achieve the goals.">objectives</a>, and <a href="#" class="bt" title="Courses of action are the specific procedures used to accomplish goals and objectives. They address the what, who, when, where, why, and how for each threat, hazard, and function.">courses of action</a> developed in Step 3 and Step 4. As such, your team will just need to format this content into the EOP annexes. In addition to the threat- and hazard-specific and functional annexes, your team will also draft the Basic Plan section. <br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Review, Approve, and Share the Plan</strong></p>
    <p>After  your planning team has finished preparing the draft EOP, your team will <a href="#" class="bt" title="Note: Your planning team will have to review the school EOP two different times in the six step planning process, in Step 5 and Step 6.

After reviewing the draft and revising the plan,  your planning team must obtain official approval of the plan and then share the  plan with community partners and additional stakeholders who may have a role in  the plan. </p>
    <p><strong>Outcome of Step 5</strong></p>
    <p>At  the conclusion of Step 5, your planning team will have an approved EOP that is  ready to be implemented by your school. </p>

    <p><strong>Develop the Basic Plan and Revise the Formatted Draft </strong></p>
<p>At this stage, school core planning teams have already developed the content and framework for the threat- and hazard-specific and functional annexes. You will need to work with schools to revise the formatted plan according to writing conventions, provide comments along the way, and help facilitate connections between school core planning teams and stakeholders. In addition, school core planning teams will need to draft the Basic Plan section. You will also need to work with schools to create an exercise program and establish a process for plan review and revisions. </p>
<p><strong>Review the Plan for Quality and Approve and Share the Plan</strong> <br>
  After school core planning teams have finished preparing their draft EOPs, your team will develop a framework for reviewing and approving the plans.

  At the conclusion of Step 5, school core planning teams will have approved EOPs that are ready to be implemented at their school sites.</p>
