    <p><strong>Use Scenario-Based Planning</strong></p>
    <p>Your team&rsquo;s first task in developing courses of action is to use scenario-based planning to imagine the different ways that a threat or hazard may unfold, and the steps your school and community partners should take to address those threats and hazards&mdash;either with functions or with threat- and hazard-specific procedures. </p>
    <p><strong>Develop Courses of Action for Threats and Hazards</strong></p>
    <p>Next, using the scenarios that your planning team just imagined, your team will develop courses of action that clearly describe how your school and community partners will enact procedures  to address specific threats and hazards.</p>
    <p><strong>Develop Courses of Action for Functions</strong></p>
    <p>Likewise, your planning team will use the scenarios to develop courses of action that clearly describe how your school and community partners will enact different functions.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome of Step 4</strong></p>
    <p>At the conclusion of Step 4, your planning team will have courses of action for each threat, hazard, and function. Along with the goals and objectives developed in Step 3, the courses of action will form the primary content in the Functional Annexes and Threat- and Hazard-Specific Annexes sections of your school EOP. In Step 5, your team will format the goals, objectives, and courses of action into actual sections of the school EOP.</p>

<p><strong>Use Scenario-Based Planning</strong> <br>
  This approach prompts planning teams to imagine the different ways that a threat or hazard may unfold, and the steps your schools and community partners should take to address those threats and hazardsâ€”either with functions or with threat- and hazard-specific procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Develop Courses of Action for Threats and Hazards</strong> <br>
  Your team&rsquo;s first task is to support schools in their development of customized, site-specific courses of action that address goals and objectives.
